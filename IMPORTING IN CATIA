==> AFTER OBTAINING THE RESPECTIVE POINTS IN THE EXCEL SHEETS, COPY THOSE POINTS SUCH THAT YOU GET X,Y AND Z COORDINATES.

=> IF OBTAINED POINTS CONSISTS ONLY 2 COORDINATES X & Y (2 COLUMNS) THEN, ADD A THIRD COLUMN FOR Z COORDINATE AND 
   PLACE THE VALUE AS 0 (ZERO) FOR ALL THE ROWS UNTILL THE LAST POINT WHERE X AND Y COORDINATE IS ENDING.
   (*** IF HAVING TROUBLE THEN PLEASE REFER THE EXCEL SHEET GIVEN  (NAME: 'nozzlepts.xls') ***)

  8) GO TO "COMMAND"
  
  9) LOOK FOR "GSD_PointSplineLoftFromExcel", YOU CAN COPY AND STORE THE FILE IN YOUR DESKTOP FOR FUTURE USE.
  
  10) OPEN THE FILE AND PASTE THE COORDINATES AS SHOWN BELOW :
         
          StartLoft
          
          StartCurve
          
          ""paste all points here """
          
      ''' example:
          
          1 2 0

          EndLoft
          
          End

===> TO DISPLAY THE CURVE IN CATIA:
 
      1) OPEN CATIA 
      
      2) OPEN MECHANICAL DESIGN -> PART DESIGN -> GIVE PART NAME -> OK -> SELECT XY PLANE -> CLICK SKETCH.
      
      3) NOW OPEN THE GSD_PointSplineLoftExcel FILE FROM BEFORE, GO TO VIEW -> MACROS-> IN THE "macros in :" SELECT "GSD_PointSplineLoftFromExcel.xls".
      
      4) NOW SELECT "Feuil1.Main" AND CLICK RUN.
      
      5) ENTER "1" TO GENERATE ONLY POINTS, ENTER "2" FOR POINTS WITH SPLINE, ENTER "3" FOR POINTS WITH SPLINE AND LOFT.
      
      6) AFTER ENTERING THE NUMBER CLICK "OK", NOW THE NOZZLE CONTOUR WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THE CATIA PART DESIGN, OPEN CATIA TO TAKE A LOOK.
